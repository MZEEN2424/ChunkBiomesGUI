# ChunkBiomesGUI

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) version of [Chunkbiomes](https://github.com/Nel-S/Chunkbiomes), which ports certain filters from [Chunkbase](https://chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map) so features can be searched for across thousands of seeds every second. Currently this tool supports Windows platforms and is designed for *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition*, for helping users find seeds with specific Minecraft structures.

## Features:
This tool supports
- Villages,
- Pillager Outposts,
- Ruined Portals,
- Shipwrecks,
- Desert Temples,
- Jungle Temples,
- Igloos,
- Swamp Huts,
- Woodland Mansions,
- Ocean Monuments, and
- Ancient Cities.

It can
- Search for seeds within a 32-bit or 64-bit range, or within a specifically-defined range;
- Halt after encountering a result, or continue searching continuously; and
- Finding multiple structures.
- Clear, save, or copy the found seeds for later use.

In the future, this tool will hopefully also support ravine and biome conditions.

## Build Instructions
Pre-built executables are available in [the releases tab](https://github.com/MZEEN2424/ChunkBiomesGUI/releases). If those fail for your machine, the program can also be built manually.
This tool relies on [Dear ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) as well as Chunkbiomes.

1. If you don't already have them, install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's main directory.
3. Run the batch file named `build.bat` to start the build process.
4. Once the process is complete, the executable (`.exe`) file will be located in the `build/bin` directory.
