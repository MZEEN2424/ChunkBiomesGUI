# ChunkBiomesGUI

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) version of [Chunkbiomes](https://github.com/Nel-S/Chunkbiomes), which ports certain filters from [Chunkbase](https://chunkbase.com/apps/seed-map) so features can be searched for across thousands of seeds every second. Currently this tool supports Windows platforms and is designed for *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition*, for helping users find seeds with specific Minecraft structures.

## Features:
This tool supports
- Villages,
- Pillager Outposts,
- Ruined Portals,
- Shipwrecks,
- Desert Temples,
- Jungle Temples,
- Igloos,
- Swamp Huts,
- Woodland Mansions,
- Ocean Monuments, and
- Ancient Cities.

It can
- Search for seeds within a 32-bit or 64-bit range, or within a specifically-defined range;
- Halt after encountering a result, or continue searching continuously; and
- Finding multiple structures.
- Clear, save, or copy the found seeds for later use.

In the future, this tool will hopefully also support ravine and biome conditions.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE:

This application is a desktop port of Chunkbase's seed finding functionality. The core functionality and algorithms are based on **[Chunkbase](https://www.chunkbase.com/)**, created by **Alexander Gundermann** and the Chunkbase development team. Please support the original project by visiting their website.
